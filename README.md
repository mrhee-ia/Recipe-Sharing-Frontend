# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This is my first attempt in trying to make a decent project after and/or during my study of react javascript; learning frontend development. Could be messy and incomplete. The purpose of this website is to offer users a vibrant online community where food enthusiasts can share and discover recipes from around the world. Users can post their favorite recipes with complete list of ingredients, detailed instructions, images, and videos, while also exploring a diverse collection of dishes. Users can engage with others in real-time by liking, commenting, and replying. At the same time, creating a personalized profile to showcase their culinary creations and be able to connect with fellow cooks all around the world.
